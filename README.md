My Personal Website

Since I could write HTML, I've made personal websites to showcase my projects and personality. I went through many designs, especially after learning how to copy and paste from Bootstrap. I was like that one meme about changing your front end every couple of months. In my junior year of high school, I think I finally designed one from the ground up that I really liked and haven't changed it since. React and Angular are cool and all but... I think static HTML sites have a special place in my heart.
