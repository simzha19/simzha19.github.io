      <p>
        Rebuild Our Shops is a site that curates information to support the locally owned businesses that have suffered from rioting and looting as well as the pandemic. We created this site in order to list locally owned businesses, bring attention to their fundraising efforts, as well as give users a place to find companies that have been looted after the protests and pandemic are over.

      <h2>BTPhysics (now defunct)</h2>
      <p>
        BTPhysics is a site and Youtube channel that is centered around Bergen
        Tech's physics curriculum. I used Jekyll to make a static site hosting
        videos that go step by step in solving physics problems. However, BT has
        since claimed those videos.

        look like.
